# Min-Max value of the healthy humanbeing

* Cholestrol Level

* less than 200 miligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) are considereddesirable for adults.
* 200-239(mg/dl) is considered borderline high.
* 240 and above is considered high.
* LDL cholestoral levels should be less than 100 (mg/dl).
 
* Fasting blood sugar levels

* less than 100 mg/dl(5.6 mmol/L)is normal.
* 100-125 mg/dl (5.6 to  6.9 mmol/L) is considered as prediabetes.
* 126 mg/dl (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests , you have diabetes. oral glucose tolerance test.

* Heart rate  normal range
 
* Heart rate for adults ranges from 60-100 per minte.
  *Generally, a lower heart rate at rest implies more efficient heart function and better cardiovascular fitness. For example , a well trained althlete might have a normal resting  heart rate closer to 40 beats per minute.
